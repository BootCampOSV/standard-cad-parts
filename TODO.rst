Port issues from split libraries to the new merged library

Generator in json

A Sphinx export of the json library would be a nice feature. This would allow exporting the library to a web page or a pdf file.

Bearings
========

******** Issue #1 : The library should contain a metadata or "header" field including t least : description, author, version, date

******** Issue #2 : I do think lengths are in mm. This should explicitely be described in the library.

Issue #3 : From the SKF website, the ISO series for bearings spec.
http://www.skf.com/uk/products/bearings-units-housings/roller-bearings/principles/bearing-data-general/tolerances/diameter-series-identification/index.html

******** Issue #4 : Dimensions are not the only information related to bearings: other information such as dynamic load or static load ratings, bearing weight are also useful to compute bearing life. This should be part of the library.

Issue #5 : A Sphinx export of the json library would be a nice feature. This would allow exporting the library to a web page or a pdf file.

Issue #6 : Anchors on parts generated by the library

Issue #7 : How to manage tolerances?
